# Expense Tracker (MERN)

> Your personal Expense Tracker App

## Inspiration
In January 2022, I started working as a Software Developer at Accipiter Radar Technologies and this was my first industry job. As you start generating income, expense follow. I was spending a lot of money on  rent, transportation, foods, and other necessities. It was hard for me to keep track of my expenses, so I decided to create an App that would help me manage my expenses. Not to mention, I thought if I had trouble keep track of my expenses so would other people.
